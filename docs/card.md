Use to wrap content in a nice solid, bordered container. Works well sitting on top of an email body with a `.bg-light` class.

You can use a card with or without a `.card-body`. Just like in Bootstrap a `.card-body` is just used to give padding to the card.

```html
<div class="card">
  <div class="card-body">
    This is some text within a card body.
  </div>
</div>
```

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-body">
    This is some text within a card body.
  </div>
</div>
