There are two visibility classes you can apply to elements to show or hide it on a mobile vs desktop device. These are different than how this works in Bootstrap.

`.d-desktop` will show an element on desktop and hide it on mobile.

`.d-mobile` will show an element on mobile and hide it on desktop.
